    <string name="aboutTradify">In ancient times when there was no currency, people used to trade goods to fulfill their needs.
Though, the world has evolved and today we have currency to purchase goods and fulfill our needs, still sometimes there
arise a need when we want to trade things we donâ€™t need with the things we want which people around us might have.
Our app will provide a platform for people to trade their goods, it might be anything from books to books or books to calculator.
We will match users according to the products they have up for exchange and the things they need. Moreover, people can also rent
and sale any product through this platform.</string>
